# NOTE THAT if at one point your keywords are too many,
# you can always copy this script into another file specific
# for your project.  For example, cp ~/bin/wb to ~/bin/samc
# (and don't forget change "< $HOME/bin/wb" to "< $HOME/bin/samc"
# as well.  Then you can simply type "samc result", "samc todo", etc.
# and keep "wb" for general links.
