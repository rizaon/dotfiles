## open a blog file. I have one per project

#!/bin/bash

PROJECT=$1.blog
MODE=$2

PROJECT_FILE=$RESEARCH/$PROJECT

## if -l, just list my blogs

if [ "$1" == "-l" ]; then
	echo "Available blogs:"
	ls -li $RESEARCH
	exit
fi

## if not found, then exit

if [ ! -f $PROJECT_FILE ]; then
	echo "[BLOG] $PROJECT_FILE does not exists!"
	exit
fi

## otherwise open, depends on mode

case $MODE in 
    -v)
          echo "[BLOG] Opening in visual mode with visual-editor"
          visual-editor $PROJECT_FILE 
          ;;
     *)
          echo "[BLOG] Opening in bash mode with editor"
          editor $PROJECT_FILE 
          ;;
esac
