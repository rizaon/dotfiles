# if you use Mac, then use something like this below.
# you need to choose your own favorite pdf reader 
# (e.g. acroread, skim, preview.app)
# i like skim.app 


#open -a /Applications/Skim.app $*
open -a /Applications/Preview.app $*


# if you Linux user, then you need to find where your 
# pdf reader is by running for example "which acroread".
# after you know the full path, enable this:

# /usr/bin/acroread $*
